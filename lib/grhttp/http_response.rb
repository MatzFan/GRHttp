module GRHttp

	# this class handles HTTP response.

		# Creates a streaming block. Once all streaming blocks are done, the response will automatically finish.

		# This avoids manualy handling {#start_streaming}, {#finish_streaming} and asynchronously tasking.
		#
		# Every time data is sent the timout is reset. Responses longer than timeout will not be sent (but they will be processed).
		#
		# Since GRHttp is likely to be multi-threading (depending on your settings and architecture), it is important that
		# streaming blocks are nested rather than chained. Chained streaming blocks might be executed in parallel and 
		# suffer frome race conditions that might lead to the response being corrupted.
		#
		# Accepts a required block. i.e.
		#
		#     response.stream_async {sleep 1; response << "Hello Streaming"}

		#       response << "Hello Streaming"
		#       response.stream_async do

		# Creates nested streaming blocks for an enumerable object. Once all streaming blocks are done, the response will automatically finish.
		#
		# Since streaming blocks might run in parallel, nesting the streaming blocks is important...

		#
		# If an Array is passed to the enumerable, it will be changed and emptied as the streaming progresses.
		# So, if preserving the array is important, please create a shallow copy of the array first using the `.dup` method.

		#
		#      data = "Hello world!".chars
